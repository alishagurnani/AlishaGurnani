## Overeducation: The Effects of the Great Recession on the Labor Market

#### This repository holds my code, sample data, and my Thesis paper for my final Thesis project from my Master's program.

#### My thesis looks at how overeducation changed before, during, and after the Great Recession of 2007-2009. Using GDP as a proxy variable for the recession I was able to conduct logistic regressions (Code/Thesis_Logisitic_Regressions.Rmd) to analyze whether or not the state of the economy was correlated to the rate of individuals that were overeducated at the time.
#### After running several models with different control variables, I found that overeducation and recessions are slightly positively correlated. However, using a more comprehensive proxy, one that measures several aspects of the economy would provide more information on how overeducation and the recession are related to each other.
